# Overview

## Welcome to Leapp :rocket:

Leapp is a tool for developers to manage, secure, and access the cloud.

All data is **persisted and encrypted on your workstation**. Head to our [Security](security/intro) section to know how we guarantee the highest level of security.

The name **Leapp** is based on the word *leap* and is pronounced */l:ip/*. We chose this name because the project enables you to be one step away from your cloud environments.

## Introducing Leapp CLI

Leapp CLI (Command Line Interface) for Leapp is built on Node.js with [Oclif](https://oclif.io/) and the [leapp core library](#). 

You can check CLI usage [here](cli)!

It allows you to use Leapp application functionality in your terminal.

Leapp CLI is [open source on GitHub](cli).
